## Project Overview


## Project Instructions

### Instructions
12. (Optional) **If you are running the project on your local machine (and not using AWS)**, before running code, change the kernel to match the dog-project environment by using the drop-down menu (**Kernel > Change kernel > dog-project**). Then, follow the instructions in the notebook.

__NOTE:__ While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully answer all of the questions included in the notebook. __Unless requested, do not modify code that has already been included.__

## Evaluation

Your project will be reviewed by a Udacity reviewer against the CNN project [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/810/view).  Review this rubric thoroughly, and self-evaluate your project before submission.  All criteria found in the rubric must meet specifications for you to pass.

## Project Submission

When you are ready to submit your project, collect the following files and compress them into a single archive for upload:
- The `dog_app.ipynb` file with fully functional code, all code cells executed and displaying output, and all questions answered.

Alternatively, your submission could consist of the GitHub link to your repository.
